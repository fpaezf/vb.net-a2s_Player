# Valve's Source A2S_Player implementation in VB.NET

This is a functional implementation of Valve's Source A2S_Player query protocol in Visual Basic .NET.

This snippet shows how to successfully query a Source-based game server and receive the players list, including each player score (kills) and the connection time (in seconds). 

⚠️**WARNING:** Valve hasn't implemented yet this feature in **Counter-Strike 2** servers. Works well in **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** and **Counter-Strike: Source** servers.

This code is implemented but still not operational in my **Counter-Strike 2 game server admin tool**: https://github.com/fpaezf/CS2-RCON-Tool-V2
